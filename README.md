🧠 **Next Word Prediction Using Deep Learning** 🤖✨

🚀 **Thrilled to share my latest Deep Learning project!**
I built a **Next Word Prediction Model**, an exciting application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that predicts the next word in a sentence — just like your smartphone keyboard! 📱💬

----

🔍 **Project Highlights:**
✨ Developed a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **LSTM layers** to understand language patterns.
🧾 Performed **text preprocessing**, including tokenization, cleaning, and sequence padding.
🧠 Trained the model to **predict the most probable next word** based on context.
📊 Analyzed **training performance** using loss curves and tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.
💻 Implemented using **Python 🐍**, **TensorFlow 🔢**, and **Keras 🧩** frameworks.

💡 **Key Outcome:**
This project showcases how **AI can understand and generate human-like text**, forming the backbone of:
🤖 Chatbots
🎙️ AI Assistants
⌨️ Autocomplete Tools

Through this project, I enhanced my expertise in **Deep Learning, Sequence Modeling, and NLP** — crucial skills for building next-gen AI solutions 🌍✨
